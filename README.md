# odin-recipes
I am building a website project focused on recipes. I hope to learn to push to git, and learn many commands
I also want to just be a bit more framiliar with all the commands and learn my Command lines better
I am proud of myself, this has not been easy but it has been fun. This gift from the community is amazing
I love my life
